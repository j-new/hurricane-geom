# Hurricane Windspeed geom

## Data

Uses data from the [Extended Best Track Dataset](http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/research/tropical_cyclones/tc_extended_best_track_dataset/)
which includes wind speed and track data for tropical cyclones from 1988-2015. 

## Overview

Custom geom for ggplot2 to visualize directional storm wind radii. The geom shows the wind radius for 34, 50, and 64 knot winds
in 4 directions to visualize the shape of a single storm.
